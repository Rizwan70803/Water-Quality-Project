# Water-Quality-Project
Analyzed environmental data and created visualizations to explore the impact of pollution on water turbidity and fish populations. The findings indicated that rainfall reduces pollution levels, which in turn lowers turbidity and phosphorus concentrations, ultimately supporting healthier fish populations.
